# IoGT

Internet of Good Things ([IoGT][2]) is developed as a public good under a [BSD-2][3] open-source license.

The development uses the Python programming language, building on the [Django][4] server-side web framework combined with the [Wagtail][5] content management system.

In line with the latest Wagtail [Long Term Support release][6], IoGT 2.x supports:
- Wagtail 2.11.x
- Django 2.2.x, 3.0.x and 3.1.x
- Python 3.8 and 3.9
- PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite as database backends

## Getting started

If you'd like to contribute to IoGT development, the best way to get started is to clone a copy of this repository and run the code on your machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/unicef/iogt.git
cd iogt
```

Create an [isolated Python environment][1], into which we will install the project's dependencies. This is highly recommended so that the requirements of this project don't interfere with any other Python environments you may have in your system, including the global Python environment. We also recommend that you create a new environment outside of the project directory.
```
python3 -m venv <path_to_venv_dir>
source <path_to_venv_dir>/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create the database. By default, an SQLite database will be created.
```
./manage.py migrate
```

Create a superuser account for administration purposes.
```
./manage.py createsuperuser
```

Compile .po language files stored in locale/
```
./manage.py compilemessages
```

Finally, start the server.
```
./manage.py runserver
```

Once running, navigate to http://localhost:8000 in your browser.


### Running ElasticSearch (Optional)

1. Set up an elastic search cluster
2. Update local.py to use Elasticsearch as the backend. More details [here](https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/topics/search/backends.html#elasticsearch-backend)
   ```
   WAGTAILSEARCH_BACKENDS = {
    'default': {
        'BACKEND': 'wagtail.search.backends.elasticsearch7',
        'URLS': ['http://localhost:9200'],
        'INDEX': 'iogt',
        'TIMEOUT': 5,
        'OPTIONS': {},
        'INDEX_SETTINGS': {},
        'AUTO_UPDATE': True,
        'ATOMIC_REBUILD': True
        }
   }
   ```

3. Run `./manage.py update_index` to update the ElasticSearch Index

### Setting up test data

It is possible to automatically populate the database with example data for a basic test site.
```
./manage.py create_initial_data
```

Optionally, create the main menu automatically as well.
```
./manage.py autopopulate_main_menus
```


### Running Tests
```
./manage.py test --settings=iogt.settings.production
```

## Setup with Docker Compose

You can choose to set up the project locally using Docker Compose. This setup is recommended if you want to replicate the production environment.

### Steps

Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/unicef/iogt.git
```
Run setup command. This will set up the database and also update the ElasticSearch Index.
```
cd iogt
make setup
```

Create a super user account for administration purposes.
```
docker-compose run django python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Run the compose file
```
make up
```
You're all set now. See the `Makefile` for other commands related to docker-compose

## Setting up test data

It is possible to automatically populate the database with example data for a basic test site.
```
docker-compose run django python manage.py create_initial_data
```

Optionally, create the main menu automatically as well.
```
docker-compose run django python manage.py autopopulate_main_menus
```

## Running Tests

Run the following commands:
```
make tests
make selenium-test
```

In parallel, for example, with 4 processes:
```
IOGT_TEST_PARALLEL=4 make test
IOGT_TEST_PARALLEL=4 make selenium-test
```

More details of the Selenium tests can be found in the [Selenium test README][9].

## Configuring the Chatbot

Follow instructions [here](messaging/README.md)

## Configuring wagtail-transfer

It is possible to pull articles from other deployments assuming we know the secret key for that deployment.

In `iogt/settings/local.py`, define [parameters from wagtail-transfer](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail-transfer/blob/master/docs/settings.md) as appropriate, e.g.:
```
WAGTAILTRANSFER_SECRET_KEY = 'fake_secret_key'
WAGTAILTRANSFER_SOURCES = {
   'iogt_global': {
      'BASE_URL': 'http://fake-iogt-url.org/wagtail-transfer/',
      'SECRET_KEY': 'fake_secret_key_2',
   },
}
```
Note: the names of transfer sources may only contain letters, numbers and underscores.

## Adding new localizable strings to the code base

After adding new strings to the code base that are user-facing (see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/i18n/translation/ ), follow the following process:
1. Run `./manage.py translation_tracking`
2. Review and update `common/translation_utils/translation_status.csv`. Strings that only appear in the admin backend don't need to be tagged as `translate`, only those that face users. See [here](common/translation_utils/README.md) for details.
3. Rerun `./manage.py translation_tracking`

This process updates PO files as necessary and compiles a list of strings that appear in the translation manager in the admin backend.

**Remark:** The file `common/translation_utils/translations.csv` is NOT updated in the process.
Even though it has a column "is in use", its data is currently not updated automatically, and similarly, new strings are not added automatically.

## Apache Superset Setup and Configuration
- See [here](questionnaires/superset/README.md)

## Page caching

Page caching is provided by Wagtail Cache and is deactivated by default. To start caching pages, follow the [activation intructions][7].

## Migrating content from IoGT v1
Follow instructions [here](iogt_content_migration/README.md)
